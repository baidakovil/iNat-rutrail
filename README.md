# iNat-rutrail
Aim of this project is to create 89 iNaturalist project (number at early 2024), with each of them linked to one of RuTrail tourist trails. Each project should have map with polygons, shaping areas around tourist trail.  
Having this, each tourist can see which plants and animals, fungi and lichens it can see on the trail.

How does it look on iNaturalist:
